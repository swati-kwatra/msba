    "The purpose of this exercise is to analyze the sentiment around the contentious issue of 'Border wall'. The analysis was performed by giving a score to each tweet followed by categorizing the tweets as \"positive\", \"negative\" or \"neutral\" on the basis of this score. The score for each tweet is calculated by looking up each word in the tweet against a list of positive and negative words, followed by assigning a +1 for every positive and -1 for every negative word in that tweet.\n",
